# Classification of images belonging to imagenette_6class.
The dataset is a subset of fast.ai's Imagenette dataset.
An incremental design approach to image classification using Convolution Neural Networks
* CNN_1a.ipynb - Implementation of simple VGG-lite CNN model for image classification. The CNN structure is shown in the figure "cnn_structure.JPG".
* CNN_1b.ipynb - Addition of 'dropout' to the baseline network developed in CNN_1a.ipynb.
* CNN_1c.ipynb - Addition of 'data augmentation' to the baseline network developed in CNN_1a.ipynb.
* CNN_1d.ipynb - Addition of 'batch normalization' to the baseline network developed in CNN_1a.ipynb.
* CNN_1e.ipynb - Implementation of a CNN model using the combination of 'dropout' and 'data augmentation' to optimize the model's performance.


All the necessary curves, plots, diagrams and metrics have been visualized in the Colab notebooks.
